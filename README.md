# SARTHI
SARTHI(Systematic Application Regulating Total Health Information ) 
 is a basic prototype which could
be used in three areas with different modifications. Firstly it could be used as
an app-only integrated with arogya setu app to make a complete healthcare
application which could be downloaded in mobile phones. Secondly, it could
be installed in villages which lack basic medical facilities. We can have a
medical room which is powered using solar panels and a battery backup and
there we can have a computer where unwell people can come and give their
data. Here we can attach a pulse sensor, infrared thermometer and an
automatic sanitization machine so that everything including the seat is
sanitized. Thirdly, it can be used as a receptionist at a hospital which takes
data and adds it in a hospital database. This project is highly user
friendly and could be utilized by disabled also after some modifications like
using Braille keyboard for the visually impaired person. Also, this project
speaks to them(using playsound module) about what is to be entered now and also warns them if their
symptoms match with COVID 19. Also, I have made this project is bilingual
but it can be converted into multilingual as well. Write now it's in Hindi
and English.
